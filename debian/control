Description: Passive Real-time Asset Detection System
 prads is a "Passive Real-time Asset Detection System".  It passively
 listen to network traffic and gathers information on hosts and
 services it sees on the network.
 .
 This information can be used to map your network, letting you know
 what services and hosts are alive/used, or can be used together with
 your favorite IDS/IPS setup for "event to host/service" correlation.
 .
 Prads is inspired by passive.sourceforge.net,
 lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f and others.
