==========
#TODO Passive Real-time Asset Detection System
==========

1. Add a switch to make the output better for sguil
2. Discover host on ICMP too
3. Discover Network Assets based on ARP.
4. Internal table of [hosts(IP),services(port-#),ID string(banner of service or string that match),timestamp]
5. TCP / ICMP Statistic Information ?

6. p0f - Passive OS fingerprinting...
   - Together with discovering hosts (and trying to get OS from banner strings etc.), PRADS should
     emulate p0f logic to detect OS based on tcp/icmp/udp... fingerprinting...
   - Start with SYN fingerprinting...

7. Different output plugins...
   - PoC should send to stdout or/and logfile (text).
   - Next would be mysql
   - Sguil

8. GUI - by web or "desktop"
   - See your network, different OS and services.
   - See firewalls
