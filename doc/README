# Passive Real-time Asset Detection system!

# Baut'
Is a `Passive Real-time Asset Detection System`. It passively listen to network traffic and gathers information on hosts and services it sees on the network. This information can be used to map your network, letting you know what services and hosts are alive/used, or can be used together with your favorite IDS/IPS setup for "event to host/service" correlation etc.

# USE
There are several ways to use PRADS. May it sniff your network for a while,
and then you can run $ sqlite3 prads.db "select * from asset;"
to dump the database of assets.

Examples of gamelinux.org:
$ sqlite3 prads.db "select * from asset;"|grep SYN|grep ^87.238.45.168
87.238.45.168|SYN|1242806866|S4:64:1:60:M1460,S,T,N,W4:.||@Linux|2.6 (Generic dfrag+)|"ethernet/modem" |7|equador
87.238.45.168|SYNACK|1242634479|5792:64:1:60:M1460,S,T,N,W4:ZA||Linux|2.6 (newer, 4)|"ethernet/modem" |7|equador
87.238.45.168|SYNACK|1242647505|S4:64:1:44:M1460:ZA||Linux|recent 2.4 (2)|"ethernet/modem" |8|equador
87.238.45.168|SYNACK|1242647509|5792:64:1:60:M1460,N,N,T,N,W4:ZA||UNKNOWN|UNKNOWN|"ethernet/modem" |8|equador

sqlite3 prads.db "select * from asset;"|grep SER|grep ^87.238.45.168
87.238.45.168|SERVICE|1242634479|80||Apache|Debian|2.2.3|1|equador

The tables are :
ip|service|time|fingerprint|mac|os|details|link|distance|reporting

ip          = The ip address of the asset
service     = The "Service" detected, like: TCP-SERVICE, UDP-SERVICE, SYN, SYNACK,MAC,.....
time        = The timestamp when the data was collected
fingerprint = The fingerprint that the match was done on
mac         = The MAC address of the asset (service = ARP)
os          = The Operating System (OS) matched (service = SYN/SYNACK)
              The MAC vendor that is matched (service = ARP)
details     = More details on OS (service = SYN/SYNACK)
              More details on MAC vendor (service = ARP)
              More details on Service (service = SERVICE)
link        = Linktype guessed (service = SYN/SYNACK)
distance    = Distance based on guessed initial TTL (service = SYN/SYNACK)
reporting   = Hostname of host running PRADS (For multi-prads environments)

# SNORT (snort.org) / Sguil (sguil.net)
In the future, it should be possible to generate the Snort XML for the "Host Attribute Table" which was introdused in 2.8.1:
 http://snort.org/docs/snort_manual/node189.html
This would be a better way then generating it by hand each time :)

# WebGUI
There will be a webgui to the database, for easy browsing of your network etc.
